            "unit": "pg/ml",
            "referenceRange": "180.00 - 914.00",

            "note": {
              "summary": "Vitamin B12 along with folate is essential for DNA synthesis and myelin formation. Vitamin B12 deficiency can be due to nutritional deficiency, malabsorption, and other gastrointestinal causes. The test is ordered primarily to help diagnose the cause of macrocytic/megaloblastic anemia.",
              "decreasedLevels": "Decreased levels are seen in anemia, normal near-term pregnancy, vegetarianism, partial gastrectomy/ileal damage, celiac disease, with oral contraceptive use, parasitic competition, pancreatic deficiency, treated epilepsy, smoking, hemodialysis, and advancing age.",
              "increasedLevels": "Increased levels are seen in renal failure, hepatocellular disorders, myeloproliferative disorders, and at times with excess supplementation of vitamin pills.",
              "additionalInfo": "*Please note test values may vary depending on the assay method used."

            "unit": "ng/ml",
            "referenceRange": "Deficiency: < 20, Insufficiency: 20 - 29, Sufficient: 30 - 100, Toxicity: > 100",

              "summary": "Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble steroid hormone precursors responsible for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, and multiple other biological effects, which is mainly produced in the skin by exposure to sunlight. Vitamin D from the skin synthesis is biologically inactive; hydroxylation in the liver and kidneys is required for activation.",
              "biologicalDetails": "Vitamin D is transported to the liver and then converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the bloodstream, which is further converted in the kidneys to the active form, 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D.",
              "halfLife": "The half-life of circulating vitamin D (25-OH) is three weeks, while the 1,25 hydroxy form has a much shorter half-life of four hours.",
              "functions": "Vitamin D regulates the balance of calcium and phosphorus metabolism, and bone formation, and is closely related to cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and hypertension."
